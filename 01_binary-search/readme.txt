Attach or link a document explaining your best OR worst solution

a. What makes it good/bad?
The 3rd is my worst. It's the same as 2 but with extra maths. Less readable and more code. It calculates the number
of iterations needed in the worst case scenario, which has the same outcome as "while (high >= low)". But I think
the logic for checking the middle index and discarding the left/right side is good.

b. Did you need help, with what?
The worst case formula and the parameterized test.

c. Was it easy or hard?
The basic logic was fairly easy. Coming up with a 3rd solution was hard.

d. Did you do any improvements to anything?
At first there were a lot of messy and redundant if statements in my solutions that I removed.
