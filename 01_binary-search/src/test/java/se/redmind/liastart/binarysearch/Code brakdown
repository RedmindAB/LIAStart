Required:
1. Explain the best or worst solution for the project:

My best solution would have to be the one that been commented out in the code. This to me makes it easier for the
recepient or another code to see my workflow with ease. I also named the variables in a manner that allows the 
recepient or reader of my code and understanding of what I want my code to do.
The disadvantage of this type of code is that it takes up a lot of lines to make it work

The functionality of the second code is probably the best since it takes up a few lines of code. It also worked with a much simpler logic.

2. Did I need help?

Yes, I had to ask my colleagues of their different ways of thinking after I had come up with my solution since it was required of us to produce three methods in this homework.
It was fun to see that my colleagues and I had a similar way of thinking but wrote totally different code.

3. Did I do any improvements to anything?
Actually none. I simply added my code to the existing code. However, that is also to say that I saw others perspectives and took into account how others have broken down their trains of thought.
