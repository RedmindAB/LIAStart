*What makes it good/bad?*  

My best solution is the one using the ready made method from Arrays.


*Did you need help, with what?*  

I needed help getting on the right path with the algorithms.


*Was it easy or hard?*  

Finding an original solution (I did not) was hard. Figuring out the desired structure for the classes and test classes was hard aswell. 


*Did you do any improvements to anything?*

No.
