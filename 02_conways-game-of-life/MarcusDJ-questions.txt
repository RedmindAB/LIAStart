1. Are you happy with your code?

Yes and no. I think it turned out pretty good. I started out thinking I wanted to do something fancy with streams. Therefore choosing Arraylists instead of 2d arrays, which was the more obvious choice from the start. 
Turned out that in the end I didn't end up using any streams and my decision complicated some things, I used 2 different ways of expressing the position of the cells on the board among other things. If I was to do this assignment again i would have gone with 2d arrays. 

I feel like the code is read and follow along with. Though as I've described it could have been better.

It don't think it should be that hard to test the code. 

Is it DRY?
While looking back at the code some things could have been baked into other things and refactored. All things considered I'm pretty happy with what I made whithin the alloted time.


2. What was the hardest thing about the exercise?

Just the amount of code that had to be written. Maybe I made it a bit hard on myself by implementing a functioning GUI, because the logic of the game is quite simple and in it self isnt such a big challenge. So maybe fiddling with the GUI was the hardest part, but also really rewarding when it was done.
