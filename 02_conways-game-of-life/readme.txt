Are you happy with your code?
I was happy with the central game logic, but the gui code is a mess.

-Is it easy to read?
-Is it easy to test?
-Is it DRY?
Same for all three, I think the code that I spent time on is fairly readable and dry, but there are several parts I could
improve a lot.

-What was the hardest thing about this exercise?
The time constraint.
